## Abstract

The English Sweating Sickness (1485–1551) remains a historical enigma. Its sudden onset, profuse sweating, irregular recurrence, and abrupt disappearance defy infectious explanations. This article proposes that the disease was an acute combined toxic syndrome shaped by climate, cuisine, and toxicology.

Humid summers of the Little Ice Age fostered fungal contamination (trichothecenes, aflatoxins, ergot alkaloids). Tudor noble banquets, relying on preserved meats masked with potent local herbs (henbane, belladonna, wormwood, pennyroyal, yew), introduced tropane alkaloids, thujone, pulegone, and taxine. Toxicological synergy produced a cascade: gastrointestinal barrier disruption, impaired hepatic detoxification, cytokine storm, autonomic nervous collapse, explosive sweating, electrolyte loss, arrhythmia, and sudden death.

This framework resolves the disease’s anomalies: irregular outbreaks, social selectivity, geographic confinement, and disappearance after 1551. It situates Sweating Sickness within Tudor cultural politics, where noble affliction was seen as divine judgment, yet in retrospect reflects environmental and dietary vulnerabilities.

The hypothesis is testable through biomolecular archaeology, including LC-MS/MS analysis of dental calculus, bone collagen, and cooking residues. Reinterpreting Sweating Sickness as toxicological convergence bridges historical medicine, toxicology, and climate studies.
