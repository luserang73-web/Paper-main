## Abstract

The English Sweating Sickness (1485–1551) remains a historical enigma. Its sudden onset, profuse sweating, irregular recurrence, elite selectivity, geographic confinement, and abrupt disappearance resist conventional infectious explanations. This manuscript proposes that the syndrome may represent an **acute combined toxic exposure event** driven by **toxicological convergence**: fungal mycotoxins amplified by plant-derived toxins within the climatic and cultural context of Tudor England.

Humid summers during the early Little Ice Age plausibly increased fungal contamination of stored foods (trichothecenes, aflatoxins, ergot alkaloids). Concurrently, aristocratic cuisine and household remedies may have relied on preserved meats and potent local herbs—henbane, belladonna, wormwood, pennyroyal, and yew—introducing tropane alkaloids, thujone, pulegone, and taxines. In combination, these agents could produce a cascade involving gastrointestinal barrier disruption, impaired hepatic detoxification, neuroautonomic dysregulation, intense sweating, electrolyte derangement, arrhythmia, and rapid collapse.

This framework aims to reconcile major anomalies of the outbreaks more coherently than single-cause hypotheses and is testable using modern biomolecular archaeology (e.g., LC–MS/MS analysis of dental calculus, bone collagen, and cooking residues). Reinterpreting Sweating Sickness as toxicological convergence offers a research program bridging historical medicine, toxicology, and climate studies.

## 1. Introduction

Between 1485 and 1551, England experienced five outbreaks of a lethal disease known as the “Sweating Sickness.” Contemporary descriptions emphasize abrupt fear and malaise, feverish heat or chills, profuse sweating, palpitations, delirium, and collapse within hours, with many deaths occurring within a single day. A striking social pattern is also reported: young and middle-aged men of the nobility were disproportionately affected, while peasants, children, and household attendants were often spared. After 1551, the disease vanished.

Conventional infectious hypotheses—including influenza-like viruses, hantaviruses, and other pathogens—struggle to reconcile the reported combination of explosive time course, irregular outbreak spacing, class selectivity, limited household clustering, and permanent disappearance. This manuscript reframes Sweating Sickness as a potential **acute combined toxic syndrome** arising from a historically specific alignment of climate, storage conditions, and elite dietary or medicinal practices.

## 2. Historical and Cultural Context

The first major outbreak in 1485 coincided with the end of the Wars of the Roses and Tudor accession. Chroniclers sometimes interpreted noble deaths as divine judgment, yet practical drivers may have included food storage disruption and aristocratic banquet culture.

Tudor elites consumed large quantities of preserved meats and rich fats. Spoilage masking and household remedies may have increased reliance on strongly aromatic local herbs. Unlike continental elites with increasing access to imported spices, English households may have used indigenous plants more frequently. Several candidates often discussed in historical herbals—henbane (*Hyoscyamus niger*), belladonna (*Atropa belladonna*), wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*), pennyroyal (*Mentha pulegium*), and yew (*Taxus baccata*)—contain compounds that can plausibly disturb neuroautonomic and cardiovascular function. In parallel, damp storage could increase fungal contamination of grains, meats, and animal feed.

## 3. Methods (Synthesis Framework)

This is a multidisciplinary synthesis intended to generate a falsifiable model.

### 3.1 Historical Source Review
Primary descriptions were reviewed for:
- symptom sequence and timing  
- mortality demographics  
- household clustering and caregiving exposure  
- seasonality and geographic clustering  
Key primary reference: John Caius (1552).

### 3.2 Paleoclimate and Storage Plausibility
Published reconstructions (tree rings, ice cores, rainfall proxies) were used qualitatively to assess whether outbreak years plausibly coincide with humid or unstable summers that could increase fungal proliferation and storage failures.

### 3.3 Toxicological Mechanism Mapping
A mechanism map was constructed from modern toxicology describing:
- intestinal barrier injury (e.g., trichothecenes)  
- hepatic detoxification impairment (e.g., aflatoxin-related pathways)  
- vasospasm / vascular instability (e.g., ergot alkaloids)  
- anticholinergic and neuroautonomic disruption (e.g., tropane alkaloids)  
- arrhythmogenic risk (e.g., taxines)  

### 3.4 Test Strategy (Biomolecular Archaeology)
Candidate measurable markers:
- alkaloid residues and metabolites in dental calculus  
- mycotoxin-related metabolites/adducts in bone/collagen (where feasible)  
- residues in cooking vessels, kitchen soils, and milling contexts

## 4. Results (Model Outputs as Historical Fits)

### 4.1 Epidemiological Pattern Fit
Outbreak years: **1485, 1507, 1517, 1528, 1551**.  
The long, irregular spacing is consistent with a multi-factor alignment model (climate × storage × exposure practices) rather than typical epidemic cycling.

### 4.2 Social Selectivity Fit
Elite households plausibly experienced:
- higher meat/fat intake (enhancing absorption of lipophilic compounds)  
- higher reliance on preserved foods during spoilage risk  
- greater use of potent herbs in cuisine and remedies  
This can produce exposure differentials not expected under respiratory contagion.

### 4.3 Clinical Cascade (Plausible Combined Toxic Mechanism)
A convergence mechanism consistent with reported rapid progression:
1) **Barrier injury** (e.g., trichothecenes) → increased absorption  
2) **Detoxification stress** (e.g., aflatoxin-related hepatic burden) → prolonged systemic exposure  
3) **Neuroautonomic dysregulation** (e.g., tropanes; CNS-active compounds like thujone)  
4) **Vascular instability** (e.g., ergot-related vasospasm)  
5) **Sweating + electrolyte derangement** → arrhythmia/collapse  
> Note: “cytokine storm” is treated here as a *possible amplifier* in susceptible young adults, not a required assumption.

### 4.4 Geographic Restriction Fit
A culturally and environmentally localized exposure model explains why the syndrome was largely confined to England, with a limited 1528 continental episode plausibly linked to contact and context rather than sustained contagion.

### 4.5 Disappearance Fit
After 1551, improvements in sanitation, preservation, trade, and household practices could remove the necessary convergence conditions, consistent with permanent disappearance.

## 7. Limitations

- Direct biochemical evidence from Tudor remains is currently limited.  
- Herb usage may be under-recorded or ambiguous in surviving sources.  
- Quantitative exposure levels cannot be reconstructed with high precision.  
- Synergy assumptions rely on modern mechanistic analogues rather than Tudor-specific assays.  

These limitations are addressable via targeted residue and metabolite studies.

## 8. Recommendations for Future Research

### 8.1 Biomolecular Residue Analysis
- LC–MS/MS analysis of dental calculus  
- metabolomics on bone/collagen where feasible  
- residue analysis of cookware, knives, and kitchen soils  

### 8.2 Reconstructive Toxicology
- controlled mixture studies (trichothecenes + tropanes ± ergot alkaloids) focusing on autonomic endpoints  

### 8.3 Integrated Climate–Fungus–Storage Modeling
- simulations linking storage humidity to fungal growth and toxin production using historically plausible constraints

## 9. Conclusion

Sweating Sickness (1485–1551) remains an unresolved historical medical event. A toxicological convergence framework—where climate-driven fungal contamination aligns with elite dietary and medicinal practices involving potent plant toxins—offers a coherent, falsifiable model that addresses major anomalies in timing, selectivity, geography, and disappearance. Modern biomolecular archaeology can empirically test this model and potentially resolve a centuries-old mystery.
